DeFire Calculator - Static Web App
====================================

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
- sounds/  (optional: place fire-crackle-short.mp3 and click.mp3 here for local hosting)

Quick deploy:
1. Upload these files to your GitHub repo root (https://github.com/theRunnerz/-calculator-).
2. Wait for GitHub Pages to serve at https://therunnerz.github.io/-calculator-/

Notes:
- Open the page in the TronLink in-app browser (mobile) or desktop Chrome with TronLink unlocked.
- The Portfolio tab attempts to fetch TRC20 balances via Tronscan API and values via Tronscan price fields and CoinGecko fallback for TRX. Some DeFi positions (JustLend, Sun.io) are best-effort and may require manual price overrides for unpriced tokens.
